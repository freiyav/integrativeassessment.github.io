        <p>The day started off dull with nothing to be excited about whatsoever. 
            Some subjects allowed us to work on our integrative assessment, although despite our efforts, were still not enough. 
            Several tests and quizzes were also given to us in preparation for the upcoming periodic examination. 
            Some tests were a piece of cake, however, some were the complete opposite. 
            Take analytic geometry for example, the questions were relatively straightforward, although there was a particular question were I found to be difficult. 
            The lack of problem analysis has led to confusion, thus making my answer incorrect. 
            Although it was just one problem, it was kind of a shame because I could’ve gotten the answer correctly, but the lack of analysis prevented it from happening.

        <p>The psychosocial seminar for Grade 10 students occured today. The activity was very fun as the speaker knew how to get our
            attention. The speaker gave us important insights that we can use in our lives and enhance our emotional and social life. 
            After that activity, 10-Roentgen had a lunch together with Ma'am Crizel. I enjoyed it very much as through this,
            everyone got a chance to be closer with one another. After lunch, we continued with our classes. And as classes end,
            I went to eat out with friends and ended my day.

        <p>Today, I woke up at 9 AM and got ready instantly. 
            I only one objective today, and that is to go to Circuit, Makati and meet mu groupmates. 
            I arrived in circuit at 10:30 and we started filming for our AP Minivlog. 
            At around 11:50, we stopped filming and went to Jollibee to eat. 
            We resumed filming our minivlog afterwards. We filmed some parts at circuit's roof top or the open area above circuit mall. 
            We also went to the grocery inside the mall to film some scenes and buy some snacks. 
            We bought drinks, popcorn and stick-o that we ate at the roof top of the mall afterwards. 
            We also went to a bookstore to look for books. At around 4:00, we finished filming our minivlog for AP. 
            We then went to Chachago to rest and enjoy the rest of our time together. At 5:00, my mom came to pick us up and we went home. 
            At night, me and my family went to starbucks to hangout. And that's all for this day, dear diary.

        <p>Truly, it was a wonderful day! I get to do a lot of things that boosted the happiness in me. I woke up pretty late but at least I had the rest I have been needing. It was sunny, but not scorching. Just enough to radiate happiness among the people, as well as happiness in me. We went to church, had a day out and went to have coffee! And by we, I meant my cousins and I! It has been long gone since we all got together and this Sunday is literally the perfect day for us!

        <p>I got up early today because we were going to the Makati Circuit to do our integrative exam, thus it was a remarkable day for me. I needed to wear a white t-shirt and blue pants for our filming, so I did. We headed to Jollibees for lunch after finishing the script, and I ordered my favorite chicken joy meal before joining them for lunch. After that, we kept working toward our goals and began filming. We finished our film at 4 o'clock and went home to rest.        </p>
