                    <b><i>Leadership</i></b> is a concept that no one can agree on since it means different things to different people. 
People may have different opinions regarding what they think good leadership traits are. 
It is the leader's role to prioritize activities and guide a member's mental processes in the right direction. 
They are the ones that can unite the entire group. As a result, not everyone can be considered a leader. 
This role is only open to people with specified abilities and talents. So, what characteristics define a good leader? 
A good leader follows a specific path and has a distinctive set of qualities.

                First and foremost, a leader must be someone of high integrity. 
In a day of ever-increasing rivalry to be "successful," establishing integrity among people has become increasingly difficult. 
And, if a leader lacks integrity, expecting his followers to do the same is illogical. 
And this pattern portends a treacherous and dark future. Second, a leader must be self-assured when necessary. 
Confidence is an essential attribute for any leader to have. 
How can a leader expect their followers to trust in him if they do not believe in their own decisions? 
Third, a leader motivates their followers to be role models for others who want to make great changes in the world. 
A leader's source of inspiration may originate from a variety of sectors and corners of their life, such as persona, past, or competency.
 A leader should have a Unique Selling Point to motivate and encourage their followers. Finally, a leader must be psychologically clear. 
 Their decisions are influenced by their goals, objectives, and desires. 
 There may be many obstacles in their path, but they must maintain their focus and remain focused on the goal that they want to attain. 
 A distinct clarity would persuade followers that their leader knows what they are doing.

                    It is a challenging undertaking to be a leader. 
A statesman or great leader goes above and beyond the call of duty to achieve their tasks. 
They will not, and cannot, lose sight of their objective.
 To be a competent leader, they must comprehend all human quirks and the entire span of life. 
 They should be empathetic while also making strong, bold, and vital judgments, even if they are unpopular. 
 There will always be people who are dissatisfied with the leader, their decisions, or their leadership style. 
 When a leader attempts to please everyone, they become susceptible and perceived as weak leaders.
